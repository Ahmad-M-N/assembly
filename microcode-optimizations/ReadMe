In here, you should find my assembly and microcode optimzations for fib computations.
They are designed for the stack-based ijvm assembly - Mic 1 archtitecture.  
I have gone to the microcode to create custom CPU insturctions.  
These instructions are then going to be used in the assembly to make a fib function
