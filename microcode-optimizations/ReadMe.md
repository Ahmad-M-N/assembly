# Welcome
In here, I have created some custom CPU instructions by manipulating ALU inputs in the microcode.  
They are designed for the stack-based ijvm assembly - Mic 1 archtitecture.  
I have also put the new instuctions to test by using them to create a fib function in the assembly (that file should also be present in this folder).
